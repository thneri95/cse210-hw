# CSE‑210: BYU‑Idaho, My personal Work Repository 🧠👨‍💻

**Course**: CSE‑210 – Programming with Classes (Program and Problem Solving) 
**Author**: Tiago Neri  
 
---

## 🎯 Course Overview

CSE‑210 is centered on honing problem‑solving skills using C#. Over the semester, 
I progressed from fundamental console applications to more structured programming, object-oriented design
and collaborative applications. Each week's folder showcases my growth and mastery of each topic.

✅ Summary
This README now serves as both a portfolio and a roadmap documenting what I’ve learned in CSE‑210:

✔️ Core C# syntax & console application development

✔️ OOP principles & reusable structure

✔️ File I/O, collections, error handling, unit tests

✔️ Git-based iterative development


## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`week01/` to `week07/`** – Weekly homework assignments  
- **`sandbox/`** – Experimental area for concept exploration  
- `.vscode/` – Settings to standardize development environment

## 🗓️ Week-by-Week Progression

| Week | Topic & Skills | Key Projects |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Week 01** | Console I/O, `if`/`else`, loops | Basic grade calculators, temperature conversion |
| **Week 02** | Methods, parameters, code reuse | Refactored console utilities with modular methods |
| **Week 03** | Classes, objects, encapsulation | Created class structures: `Player`, `Team` |
| **Week 04** | Collections (`List<T>`), file I/O basics | Team rosters using `List`, simple file reads/writes |
| **Week 05** | Inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism | Designed hierarchies: `Shape` ➝ `Circle`, `Rectangle` |
| **Week 06** | Exception handling, unit testing (NUnit) | Validated input with try/catch; wrote tests |
| **Week 07** | Final integration project | Combined coursework concepts into an application |


## 🛠️ Technology & Tools

- **Language**: C#  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio or VS Code + C# extension  
- **Testing**: NUnit for automated unit tests  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub – tracked iterative changes weekly  
- **CLI Skills**:  .NET CLI commands (`dotnet run`, `dotnet test etc`)

---

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- **Problem solving** – Breaking down assignments into sub-problems  
- **Clean code** – Organized projects clearly with consistent naming  
- **Object‑oriented design (OOP)** – Built reusable, maintainable classes  
- **Error handling & testing** – Ensured code quality and reliability  
- **Version control mastery** – Weekly commits documented progress and experiments
