# 🏃🏽‍♀️ Exercise Tracking Program 🚴🏽‍♂️🏊🏽‍♂️

**A powerful and dynamic C# console application that tracks multiple physical activities using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.**

> 🧠 Designed with clean architecture, modular design, and real-world object modeling  
> 🎯 Built as a full project for **CSE 210 – Programming with Classes**  
> 📅 Developed by **Tiago Borges** | 🗓️ June 14, 2025

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Exercise Tracking Program** – a modular, extensible system that enables users to **log, monitor, and analyze** physical activity with precision and performance.

> ✅ Leverages advanced OOP: **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, and **Polymorphism**  
> ✅ Built with **extensibility in mind** for future features  
> ✅ Supports **Miles** and **Kilometers** in parallel  
> ✅ Tracks multiple real-world activities including:  
> - 🏃 Running  
> - 🚴 Cycling  
> - 🏊 Swimming  
> - 🥾 Hiking

## ✨ Features at a Glance

| 🚀 Feature                | 📋 Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌍 **Dual Unit Support**  | Metrics auto-adjust based on selected unit (Miles or Kilometers)               |
| 🧱 **OOP Architecture**   | Designed using SOLID principles and class hierarchies                         |
| 🏃 **Activity Classes**   | Four implemented activities with activity-specific behavior                    |
| 🧮 **Auto Calculations**  | Computes distance, speed, pace based on user input                            |
| 📊 **Summarized Output** | Clean, readable output via polymorphism and method overrides                  |
| 🛡️ **Input Validation**  | Prevents runtime errors with guards against invalid data                       |
| 🔁 **Polymorphic Display**| Activities are treated generically for unified summary generation              |
| 🔧 **Easily Extensible**  | New activity types can be added with minimal changes                          |

## 🏁 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)


🧾 Expected Output
week07/ExerciseTracking/screenshots/image.png


🧠 OOP Principles Demonstrated
🧩 Concept	🔍 Implementation Details
✅ Inheritance	All activity classes derive from an abstract Activity base class
✅ Encapsulation	Data members are private with public access via methods or properties
✅ Polymorphism	Methods like GetSummary() are overridden for each activity type
✅ Abstraction	Only relevant data is exposed; complexity hidden within class logic


🔮 Future Enhancements
🖥️ GUI Interface using WPF, Avalonia, or WinForms

💾 Data Persistence via JSON, SQLite or CSV logging

💪🏽 More Activity Types: Yoga, CrossFit, Weightlifting, etc

📈 Analytics Dashboard: Charts, averages, pace evolution

📆 Calendar View: Visualize weekly or monthly training

🔍 Search & Filters: By activity, date, unit system or duration
